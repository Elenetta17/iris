    <h1>Iris Measurements</h1>

    This host is sending packets generated by Iris, an internet topology measurement platform operated by the
    <a href="https://dioptra.io/">Dioptra group</a> at the LIP6 computer science laboratory of Sorbonne University in
    Paris, France. These are ping and traceroute style probe packets using either the UDP, ICMP, or TCP protocol. The
    results are used to provide data to academic
    researchers, government agencies, and civil society, to help advance a better understanding of the structure and
    performance of the internet. <br /><br />
    We have taken care to design Iris's probing so as to avoid overloading routers and end-hosts, and so as to avoid
    needlessly setting off alarms that network operators put in place to protect their systems from hostile scanning and
    attacks. If you are concerned that our packets might be causing problems, please <a
        href="mailto:admins@dioptra.io">email us</a>. We undertake to remediate
    any issues and we honor requests to add IP netblocks to our blocklist.
